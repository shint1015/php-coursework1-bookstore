### What is nonrepudiation in the context of digital systems?
By logging user actions, the user cannot deny having performed those actions later.
These logs store about what action was taken, when, and by whom.

### Why is it important for applications like online bookstores?
To ensure accountability and trust, preventing disputes over transactions or actions taken by users.
For example, it prevent a user from scamming the bookstore by denying they added a book or made a purchase.
Furthermore, it is effective for tracking responsibility in supply chains and inventory updates, and also aids in detecting internal fraud. Moreover, it helps in auditing and resolving conflicts.

### What other tools/technologies besides logging can help achieve nonrepudiation?
Blockchain technology for immutable records.
Blockchain can provide a tamper-proof ledger of transactions, ensuring that once an action is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted, thus enhancing nonrepudiation.
Digital signatures to verify the authenticity of actions.
Digital signatures can ensure that actions taken by users are verifiable and cannot be repudiated, as they provide proof of origin and integrity of the data associated with the action.
